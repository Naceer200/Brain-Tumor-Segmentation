IMAGE SEGMENTATION
Image segmentation is a fundamental process in image processing, involving the partitioning of an image into multiple segments to simplify or change its representation for easier analysis. This technique is widely applied in various domains, including medical imaging, computer vision, and pattern recognition. The process of image segmentation has been the subject of extensive research, leading to the development of diverse techniques and algorithms to address its challenges. Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Various techniques have been explored for this purpose, including deep learning models, image processing approaches, and segmentation algorithms. Deep learning methods, such as deep neural networks and deep generative models, have shown success in brain disease diagnosis [1]. Additionally, automated segmentation methods have been developed, allowing rapid identification of brain and tumor tissue with accuracy comparable to manual segmentation, making them practical for clinical use [2]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of mean shift clustering and content-based active segmentation algorithms in brain tumor segmentation has been elaborated [3].
The use of advanced technologies like deformable registration, diffusion reaction modeling, and supervised classification using support vector machines has been investigated for glioma image segmentation [4]. Additionally, the application of deep interactive geodesic frameworks for 3D brain tumor segmentation from FLAIR images has been validated [5]. Furthermore, the use of deep feature fusion for segmentation of human motion injury ultrasound medical images has been explored, demonstrating a maximum segmentation error rate of 2.68% [6].
In the context of medical image segmentation, the selection of appropriate kernel functions for support vector machine classifiers has been shown to yield high correct rates for segmentation of MR brain images [7]. Furthermore, the use of deep learning-based medical image segmentation methods has been reviewed, emphasizing the importance of accurate segmentation results to meet clinical requirements [8]. Additionally, the segmentation of 3-D tumor structures from MRI has been addressed as a challenging problem due to the variability of tumor geometry and intensity patterns [9]. This paper focuses on performing manual segmentation of the brain tumors by performing automatic segmentation using traditional image processing with OPENCV; and performing automatic segmentation using Deep learning method.
